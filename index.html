        <div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-success text-white ">
<p>ReproClimate Alliance community based organization  was founded on the 20th of February 2023 by a group of Kenyatta university Environmental Health students and lecturers from The Catholic University Of Eastern Africa, department of community health who came together with the objective of improving and upgrading the livelihoods of  communities in the Kisumu county. They also realized the necessity of this establishment as a means of contributing to development and meeting communities’ needs which has been the driving force and motivation. Another motivating factor to the establishment of ReproClimate Alliance community based organization is the interest that agencies and other international humanitarian institutions operating in Kisumu county had similar objectives to support projects with similar objectives as ReproClimate Alliance. in order to create participation in development at community levels led to the establishment of ReproClimate Alliance community based organization. ReproClimate Alliance community based organization has also decided to join the team of Visionaries yearning to impact and develop Kisumu county. ReproClimate Alliance community based organization like other community based organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations and International Humanitarian institutions, we aim at achieving sustainable results from developmental activities and initiatives to our communities, especially with the youth, children, women. Many regions have seen deteriorations in many areas especially at community levels. Also there have been many instances of concern where humanitarian activities haven’t been implemented as projected. Some community based organizations, NGOs and even the Government authorities who have promised to bring certain developments, improvements or interventions have in many cases failed the people of Kisumu county and this goes a long way to affect the development of the region. However there are also many community Foundations and NGOs that strive to bring development and touch lives with great impact. These organizations have great passion and are diligent in intervening to provide development. The hindering factor to their ability to be able to effectively have impact through intervention projects has been crippled by the lack of funds or adequate funds in some cases. One of these sincere organizations looking out to make a difference and great impact is ReproClimate Alliance community based organization.
